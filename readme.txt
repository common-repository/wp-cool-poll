This plugin makes it possible to create and manage a poll and display it in a widget.

= Features =

Poll management

Management of polls consists of creation, listing, editing, activation, stopping and deleting of polls. Polls consist of one poll question and several poll answers. User can also choose a color of bar assigned to every answer, which shows a percentage of votes for this answer and background color of a poll.

Poll display

Active poll can be displayed in a widget. Every poll shows number of votes for every answer and their percentual expression. Percentage is also expressed by length of assigned bar. Total number of votes is also adduced.

Every IP can vote only once. If user has not voted yet, he can vote by clicking on desired answer. After he voted, no answer is clickable anymore.

Example of poll is also shown at plugin web page - http://coolpoll.funsite.cz.

Poll report

Poll report contains records of all of the votes. Theese records consist of chosen poll answer, IP of voter and a date of vote.
